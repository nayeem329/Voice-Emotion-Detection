# Voice Emotion Detection

Voice Emotion Detection is an advanced Python project that harnesses the power of speech recognition and sentiment analysis to analyze spoken language and detect the underlying emotions conveyed by the speaker's voice. This project provides real-time emotion detection capabilities with customizable visualizations, making it a versatile tool for understanding and interpreting human emotions through speech.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Analyze live speech input to determine the emotional sentiment of the speaker instantly.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualize the detected emotions through text-based sentiment analysis results and interactive shape drawing using the Turtle graphics library, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.
- **Customization Options**: Customize the speech recognition language, shape, size, and color for a personalized user interface tailored to individual preferences.
- **Text-to-Speech Output**: Optionally hear the transcribed text spoken aloud through text-to-speech synthesis, enabling accessibility and ease of use for users with visual impairments.
